# Adventurer-Mart
A store for Adventurers in Dungeons &amp; Dragons settings.

This is a web site that was designed as a 'physical' Potion Shop that you might find in
a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. There are separate pages for each set of 'shelves' in the shop: Potions, Ingredients,
and Miscellaneous Items and Equipment.

The site features a 'Mailing List'-style form, where customers can enter personal information, with
that data being stored in an external file; there's also a dictionary of items ('Key') and their costs ('Value')
that are displayed on a separate page; and there's a conversion tool: customers can enter an amount of currency that they have
(Gold, Silver, and Copper pieces) and convert it to another form.
